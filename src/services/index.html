        <h1>Services</h1>
        
        <p>
            The service we offer is custom software development. We build software products tailored to your business. The delivery of this service consists of several phases.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Audit</h3>
        <p>
            In the first phase we set up meetings where we interview your team about a day in the life of your business.
            We ask about the details of your operations such as how you manage inventory, how you communicate with customers, and how you track sales.
            Through this audit, we build a model of your business operations. Using this model, we can attempt to identify areas that have the potential 
            to be improved through employing a custom software product.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 2: Proposal</h3>
        <p>
            In the second phase, we present some potential software solutions to be incorporated in your business operations. For each, we would show a rough design of the software,
            and communicate the business requirements that it would fulfull. In the meeting following you can provide feedback on the proposals, and discussion can ensue
            with the goal of finalizing which products are to be developed, the business requirements of each, and the cost of each.
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 3: Development</h3>
        <p>
            In the third phase, we begin the development of the software products. We will provide you with regular updates on the progress of the development.
            We will also provide you with a testing environment where you can test the software products as they are being developed. 
            Note that feedback at this time must be aligned with the established business requirements, to avoid scope creep. 
        </p>

        <h3>Phase 4: Deployment</h3>
        <p>
            In the fourth phase, we deploy the software products to your business. We will provide your team with training on how to use the software products.
            We will also define processes for reporting bugs, requesting new features and general support inquiries.
        </p>

        <p>
            We look forward to working with you!
