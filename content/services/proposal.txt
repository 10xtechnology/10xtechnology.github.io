In the second phase, we present some potential software solutions to be incorporated in your business operations. For each, we would show a rough design of the software,
            and communicate the business requirements that it would fulfull. In the meeting following you can provide feedback on the proposals, and discussion can ensue
            with the goal of finalizing which products are to be developed, the business requirements of each, and the cost of each.
