In the first phase we set up meetings where we interview your team about a day in the life of your business.
            We ask about the details of your operations such as how you manage inventory, how you communicate with customers, and how you track sales.
            Through this audit, we build a model of your business operations. Using this model, we can attempt to identify areas that have the potential 
            to be improved through employing a custom software product.
