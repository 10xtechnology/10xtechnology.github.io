        <p>
            Hello, my name is James Rao.
        </p>

            I started 10x technology in 2023 when I was leaving a Software Engineering job at the company "Enso Connect", but continued to work on projects with them, and do so to this day.
            If you are interested in learning more about my professional experience, please feel free to view my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesrao/" target="_blank">linkedin page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since then 10x has expanded to be much more than an alias through which to do contract work for a single client. I have shifted the focus of the company to 
            uplifting small businesses by building custom tools to optimize their operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            My development philosophy has always been that a product should solve a problem in the simplest way possible. 
            When I build software I prioritize performance, reliability, and maintainability.
